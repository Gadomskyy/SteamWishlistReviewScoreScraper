#What is Steam Wishlist Review Score?

Steam Wishlist Review Score scraper gets games from your steam wishlist (your wishlist needs to be public), searches for them on metacritic and return a CSV file
with both the critic score and user score. If the title could not be found, N/A will be returned instead.
